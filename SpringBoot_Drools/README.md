 Drool is a rule engine, though which we can set rules for our business logic and we can seperate hardcode conditions from business logic.


## **What is Rules ?**

Rules are pieces conditions like, "When some conditions occur, then do some task."

    `When`
            `<condition is true>`
    `Then`
            `<take desired action>`
