# 🚀 KIE Server Deployment Methods Explained

KIE (Knowledge Is Everything) is the runtime for executing Drools rules, jBPM processes, and DMN models.  
There are multiple ways to **deploy and run Drools rules**, depending on your project setup.

## 1. Overview

KIE rules can be executed in different environments:

✨ **Standalone** → KIE Server running as its own Spring Boot/Java app.  
✨ **Embedded** → Drools integrated inside another application (microservice).  
✨ **Workbench + KIE Server** → Full platform with authoring (Workbench) + runtime (KIE Server).

## 2. Deployment Methods

### 2.1 🟢 Standalone KIE Server
- A lightweight **Spring Boot / Java application** that runs rules.
- Rules (`.drl`, `.xls`, `.dtable`) are bundled inside the JAR/WAR.
- Exposes REST endpoints (like `/api/rules/validate-applicant`).
- **Good for microservices**.

**Flow:**
```
Client → REST API → KIE Server → Executes Rules → Response
```

---

### 2.2 🟡 Embedded in Spring Boot
- Drools is directly embedded in your Spring Boot app.
- No separate KIE Server layer.
- Rules are executed inside business logic.
- **Good for small apps or POCs**.

**Flow:**
```
Client → Spring Boot App → Drools Engine → Response
```

---

### 2.3 🔵 Workbench + KIE Server
- Full enterprise setup:
    - **KIE Workbench** → UI for authoring, versioning rules.
    - **KIE Server** → Executes rules deployed from Workbench.
- Rules can be **hot-deployed** via Maven repo (KJARs).
- **Good for large enterprises, centralized rule management**.

**Flow:**
```
Developer → KIE Workbench → Deploy to Maven Repo → KIE Server → Executes Rules
```

## 4. Comparison Table

| Deployment Method          | Features 🚀                        | Pros ✅                          | Cons ⚠️                         | Use Case 💡                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Standalone KIE Server**  | Spring Boot app, DRLs inside       | Lightweight, microservice ready | No central rule mgmt            | Microservices, REST rule service |
| **Embedded**               | Drools inside app logic            | Simple, no extra infra          | Hard to update rules separately | Small apps, POC, quick demos     |
| **Workbench + KIE Server** | UI authoring, versioned deployment | Centralized, enterprise-ready   | Heavyweight, more infra needed  | Enterprises with rule governance |

---

## 5. When to Use What

✅ **Standalone** → When you want a self-contained REST rule engine service.

✅ **Embedded** → When rules are tightly coupled with application logic.

✅ **Workbench + KIE Server** → When you need centralized authoring, governance, and deployment.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways

💡 **Standalone** → Best balance of simplicity and flexibility.

💡 **Embedded** → Fastest setup, but not scalable for big teams.

💡 **Workbench + KIE Server** → Enterprise-scale, but requires infrastructure.
