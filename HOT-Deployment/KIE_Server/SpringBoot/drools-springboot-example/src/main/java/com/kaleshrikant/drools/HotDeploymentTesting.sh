    HOT Deployment Features
    ======================
    üî• Dynamic Rule Reloading
    üìÅ External Rule Directory: hot-deployment/
    ‚è∞ Automatic Monitoring: Every 5 seconds
    üîÑ Manual Reload: POST /api/hot-deployment/reload
    üìä Status Check: GET /api/hot-deployment/status

    How to Use:
    1. Add DRL files to hot-deployment/ directory:
       - hot-deployment/applicant/applicant-rules.drl
       - hot-deployment/loan/loan-rules.drl

    2. Rules auto-reload within 5 seconds of file changes
    3. Or trigger manual reload via API

    4. Test with:
       - POST /api/rules/evaluate-applicant
       - POST /api/rules/evaluate-loan

    Note: The application must be running for HOT deployment to work.
    Rules are reloaded without restarting the application!
