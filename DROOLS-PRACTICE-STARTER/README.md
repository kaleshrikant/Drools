# 📘 Drools Practice with Spring Boot (Java 21)

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project is a **Spring Boot 3 + Drools** practice setup designed for learning and experimenting with **Drools Rule Engine** using **Java 21**.

It provides a **clean Gradle-based structure** to practice Drools concepts like:

- Writing simple `.drl` rules
- Using decision tables (`.xls` / `.csv`)
- Applying rule templates (`.drt`)
- Working with CEP (Complex Event Processing) features like sliding windows and timers
- Testing rules with Spring Boot context

The project uses **Spring Boot** as the application framework, making it easy to run rules inside a real-world environment (with dependency injection, services, configs, etc.).
